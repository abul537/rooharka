# Rooharka

Multi-tenant e-commerce storefront + admin platform (Next.js 16, Prisma 7, Neon Postgres).

## Setup

1. Install Node 22+ and pnpm, then `pnpm install` (this also runs `prisma generate`).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `DATABASE_URL` (pooled), `DIRECT_URL` (direct) and `ADDRESS_DATABASE_URL` (same as `DATABASE_URL` while the address tables live in the same Neon database) from the Neon **Connect** dialog. Never commit `.env`.
3. Create the platform tables (the existing `provinces` / `cities` / `localities` tables are reused as they are):
   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```
   Read Prisma's prompt carefully. It should only list **new tables** being created.
4. Load the starter data (service catalogue, the MPPMHK store, checkout field settings):
   ```bash
   pnpm db:seed
   ```
5. Run the site: `pnpm dev`, then open http://localhost:3000 and try `/checkout`.

## Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the dev server |
| `pnpm db:studio` | Browse the database in your browser |
| `pnpm db:push` | Sync the Prisma schema to the database (development) |
| `pnpm db:seed` | Insert starter data (safe to repeat) |

## Project layout

- `prisma/schema.prisma`: the whole database design, grouped and commented
- `lib/db.ts`: the shared database client
- `lib/address-db.ts` + `app/api/pakistan/*`: province / city / locality endpoints used by the checkout (read-only)
- `app/checkout`, `app/product`, `components/`: the storefront
